I'm a Computer Science undergraduate student at Universidade Federal do Paran√° [(UFPR)](https://www.ufpr.br/portalufpr/), currently in my third year. I'm also a proud Member of [CiDAMO](https://cidamo.github.io/).

## Research, interests and study topics

Currently, my interests are centered around mathematical Optimization and numerical analysis. Some topics include :
- Derivative free optimization.
- Parameter tuning.
- Non-linear continuous optimization.
- Numerical methods.

## Current projects
### DerivativeFreeSolvers.jl
A collection of derivative free solvers implemented in the julia language and compatible with the [JuliaSmoothOptimizers](https://juliasmoothoptimizers.github.io/) API.
The code is available [here](https://github.com/CiDAMO/DerivativeFreeSolvers.jl).
### PySolvers

### Bundle Adjustment

### JSOTutorials
Tutorials for the JuliaSmoothOptimizers organization, regarding the use of their packages.
